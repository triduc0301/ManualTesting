# Software Development Process (SDLC - Software Development Life Cycle)
SDLC is a systematic software development process through stages, ensuring high-quality products. The process consists of 6 main stages:
|Stage|Description|
|-|-|
|**1. Planning and Requirement Analysis**|- Business Analyst (BA) collects requirement information from the customer (KH), researches the market </br> - Works with KH to agree. </br> - Output: SRS document (Software Requirements Specification) including functions, interfaces, system sketches. </br> - Agree on the software development model.|
|**2. Design**|- Based on SRS from stage 1.</br> - Output: Sketches of system architecture, database design, UI/UX.|
|**3. Development**|- Start coding and deployment on dev environment.<br>- Output: Initial software product.|
|**4. Testing**|- After development, perform testing to detect errors.|
|**5. Deployment and Release**|- After minimizing bugs as much as possible, deploy to users (deployment on production environment).|
|**6. Maintenance**|- Improve the product based on user feedback, fix newly arising errors.|

# Software Testing Process (STLC - Software Testing Life Cycle)
STLC is a software testing process parallel to SDLC, focusing on quality validation. The process consists of 6 stages:

|Stage|Description|
|-|-|
|**1. Requirement Analysis**|Analyze SRS to determine requirements, divided into 2 types:<br> - **Functional**: Describes features (example: login, payment). <br>- **Non-Functional**: Describes performance, security, usability (example: page load time < 3 seconds, multi-device support).|
|**2. Planning**|- Testing scope, approach <br>- Functions, modules to be tested.<br> - Assign work to each tester with timeline and resources. |
|**3. Scenario Development**|Write detailed test cases based on requirements, including input, expected output, and preconditions.|
|**4. Environment Setup**|Prepare test environment (hardware, software, data) similar to production to ensure accuracy.|
|**5. Testing**|Execute test cases, record results, and log bugs if errors are detected.|
|**6. Test Closure**| - Evaluate results: Maximum number of passed test cases.<br> - Error rate reduced to acceptable level (example: < 5% critical bugs).<br> -Meet deadline from initial plan.<br> Output: Comprehensive testing report.|

# Product Development Life Cycle (PDLC - Product Development Life Cycle)
PDLC is a broader process than SDLC, including from idea to maintenance. The process consists of 7 stages:
|Stage|Description|
|-|-|
|**1. Idea**|Determine needs, product ideas, market analysis, evaluate development feasibility (feasibility study).|
|**2. Requirement Analysis**|Collect, analyze and determine functional and non-functional requirements.|
|**3. Design**|Design software architecture, interfaces, databases.|
|**4. Development**|Programming and building software based on design.|
|**5. Testing**|Perform testing to detect errors, ensure quality.|
|**6. Deployment**|Release the product to users (launch).|
|**7. Maintenance**|Improve the product based on user feedback, update new versions.|

# Testing Principles (7 Basic Principles)
These principles are based on ISTQB (International Software Testing Qualifications Board), helping testers optimize the process:
|Principle|Description|
|-|-|
|**1. Testing Shows the Presence of Defects**|Testing only proves the existence of defects, does not prove the product is defect-free.|
|**2. Exhaustive Testing is Impossible**|- Exhaustive testing takes a lot of time and high costs.<br> - Maintaining test cases becomes complex if trying to cover everything.|
|**3. Early Testing**|Participate from the requirement analysis stage to avoid major bugs, reduce repair costs (early fixes are 10-100 times cheaper).|
|**4. Defect Clustering (Pareto Principle - 80/20)**|80% of defects are often in 20% of code or important modules; focus testing on core parts.|
|**5. Pesticide Paradox**|If the same set of test cases is repeated, they will lose effectiveness in detecting new defects; need to update test cases periodically.|
|**6. Testing is Context-Dependent**|Testing methods depend on context (example: banking app needs high security testing, game needs UX testing).|
|**7. Absence-of-Errors Fallacy**|A defect-free product does not mean a useful product; need to ensure it meets user needs.|

# Software Development Models
Some popular models
|Model| Characteristics|
|-|-|
|`Agile`|- Development in small cycles (Sprint, 1-4 weeks).<br>- Allows flexible requirement changes, focuses on customer feedback.<br>- Includes Scrum, Kanban; continuous testing (TDD - Test-Driven Development).<br> - Suitable for large projects with frequent changes.|
|`Waterfall`|- Linear model, stages sequential.<br>- Main stages: Requirements → Design → Development → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance.<br>- No returning to previous stages; suitable for small projects with stable requirements.<br>- Disadvantage: Difficult to change requirements.|
|`V-Model`|- Parallelizes development and testing. <br>- Each development stage (left) corresponds to testing (right), example: Unit Test for Coding.<br>- Suitable for projects needing high reliability (like healthcare).|
