# Process From Requirements → Test Scenario → Test Case
### Conversion Process
- **Requirements**: Foundation (SRS) describing functions, user requirements. Example: "Login with email/password".
- → **Test Scenario**: Generalized into usage flows (high-level). Focus on "what" needs to be tested.
- → **Test Case**: Detailed from scenario, checking each specific aspect (low-level). Order: Requirements → Scenario → Case (traceability).

### Test Scenario (Test Scenario)
- **Definition**: General description of end-to-end flow, based on requirements.
- **Purpose**:
    - Test the application from start to finish, covering happy/negative paths.
    - Identify risks, plan, easy to share with the team.

- **Characteristics**:
    - No detailed steps (only overview).
    - Few in number, flexible.
    - Pros: Saves time, focuses on business.
    - Cons: May miss edge cases.

- **Example**: "Check transfer from A to B" (no steps listed).
- **Usage**: Planning phase, Exploratory Testing.

### Test Case (Test Case)
- **Definition**: Set of specific conditions to check if the function is correct/incorrect.
- **Purpose**:
    - Check one separate aspect (positive/negative/edge).
    - Ensure reproducible, support bug verification and regression.

- **Characteristics**:
    - Detailed steps: ID, Description, Preconditions, Steps, Input, Expected/Actual Result, Pass/Fail, Severity/Priority.
    - 1 case = 1 aspect (no combination).
    - Pros: Accurate, easy to automate.
    - Cons: Time-consuming to design.

- **Example**:
ID: TC_001
Description: Valid login.
Steps: 1. Open page. 2. Enter email/password. 3. Press Login.
Expected: Enter dashboard.

- **Usage**: Execution phase, Functional/Integration Testing.
